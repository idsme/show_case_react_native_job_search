## Review By Ids Achterhof of React Native Full Course
I have found this course to be really useful.
The YouTube video focuses on the 80% you are like to use every day.

### Efficient:
It does not waste my time with setting up scaffolding as this is supplied in the starter kit.

### Depth:
It does this by going deeper than other tutorials. 
It not like those other video 1page, 1 call to the Backend videos.

But it takes you through building multiple feature sections and pages with routing.
Content:
* Form page - A search section with multiple filters
* Overview Page - For results of the search
* Details Page 
* Routing setup
* Connecting to a Prod grade BE  

At the beginning of the video. The author goes through a number of tags and their uses.
Which I especially like as it gives you a little look on the differences between React and React Native


### Subject:
For people that are interested in getting a React Native Job. Creating a showcase app that actually searches for these jobs
by default. Is a nice side benefit. As they might actually find it while building the app.

## My personal Review - Rating:
Definitely worth watching and building, solid 9+ for me.
